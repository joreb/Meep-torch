# --- meep-torch example harness preamble (generated; do not hand-edit) -----
# Ported from examples_meep/examples/ring-cyl.py by scripts/port_upstream_example.py.
# The body below is upstream's, unchanged but for the meep import and the generated ModeSolver lines, so that a difference between
# this file and its twin is a difference between the ENGINES. See that
# script's docstring for why nothing here rewrites a call site.
#
# The literal spellings below (`matplotlib.use("Agg")`, `OUT = ...`,
# `OUT.mkdir`, `DEVICE`) are the ones
# examples/example_template.py greps for. An earlier version used private
# `_mpl` / `_OUT` names, which satisfied the RULES and failed the CHECKER on
# 216 counts -- two dialects for one convention, and the checker was right to
# complain: a rule nothing can verify is a comment.

    Several tutorials compute a result and only plot it -- binary_grating_

    data file, so a stdout-and-files comparison has nothing to say about them
    at all. The numbers are right there in the axes.
